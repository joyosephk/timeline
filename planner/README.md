## Instructions on running the planner

lpg-td-1.0 is the planner that we will be using.  For planning, you always need a domain file and a corresponding problem file. This is the command that you will use.  

`lpg-td-1.0 -o [domainFILE] -f [problemFILE] -quality` <br />

This will output the solution onto the terminal. For example, you can also do


which prints out the plan to the file 'sol1.SOL'. 


#### Note that at times, you may have to execute the planner multiple times for it to properly display the plan on the terminal.
