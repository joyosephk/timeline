### Scenario Description

Simple human-robot kitting scenario. Designed by Joseph Kim. </br>

Basically the goal is to assign agents (human or robot) to fetch blocks, inspect them, and kit them.  Agent have different capabilities (i.e., actions take different durations).  Both agents can carry only one block at a time. Blocks need to be inspected and kitted at the inspection table and the main kitting table, respectively. </br>
